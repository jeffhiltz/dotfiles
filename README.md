## Compton

I was seeing a lot of tearing, especially when watching videos in mpv.  Using compton fixes this.  On Mint I was using a [fork from yshui](https://github.com/yshui/compton/tree/master) as the original is no longer maintained.  I cloned `master` and built and installed it.  On Arch I'm just using `compton` from Community.
