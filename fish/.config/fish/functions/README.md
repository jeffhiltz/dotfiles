## Prompts

I'm using Hydro for my prompt: https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hydro

It's installed using Fisher: https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher

I don't love the asynchronous updating of the prompt for the Git status, but I'll see if I get used to it.
Other popular options are:
* https://github.com/pure-fish/pure (I chose Hydro over this because Hydro gives the actual exit status rather than just turning the prompt red.)
* https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide (this mostly looks garish, but I think can be configured to be plainer.)

The prompt that I copied, modified and used for a long time is also here, jeff_prompt.fish.
